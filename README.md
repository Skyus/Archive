These are minor college projects that are no longer under any form of active maintenance. They are mostly here for reference or if a need to reuse some of the code ever arises.

* '.Contacts': A true-caller style app for Android. It uploads the user's contacts, offers Twilio-based SMS confirmation, a messaging service, and more.
* 'Cache Simulator': Simulates a static RAM cache for a dynamic RAM cache. It was an experiment to figure out which is the most efficient caching method. Ruby scripts are included to test them.
* 'NANDEquivalent.swift': Converts any kind of logic to NAND-only logic.
* 'Optimizer': A logic optimizer that uses the Quine-McCluskey algorithm, supporting up to 16 variables. Tested and working, and heck I even use it when I need to.
* 'RemoteMediaPlayer': An app designed to play videos off a server for iOS and Android, that receives a JSON file from said service and then offers video playback.
