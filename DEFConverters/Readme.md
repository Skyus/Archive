# DEFConverters
These are a bunch of parsers and converters for the Cadence Design Exchange (DEF) format, written in Python and Python-Lex-Yacc.

`blif2def` converts from the Berkeley Logic Interchange Format (BLIF) to DEF. Work is being done on also synthesizing a power network.

`def2spef` converts from DEF to the IEEE Standard Parasitic Exchange Format (SPEF).

# Usage
For usage instructions, attempt to execute the converters without arguments.
