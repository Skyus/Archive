# Object-oriented Programming Assignments
This is a repository of my assignments for the Object-oriented Programming course.

# Usage and Dependencies
All code is in C++ and is written for the Clang compiler, but also tested with the GNU Compiler Collection.

To run the assignment, change your directory to its folder and run ./build.sh on a Unix or Unix-like system and then run the generated .bin file.

All executables are suffixed .bin for gitignore purposes.
