# Computer Architecture Lab Assignments
This is a repository of my assignments for the Computer Architecture Lab.

# Usage and Dependencies
All code is in Verilog and tested on either [CloudV](https://cloudv.io/) or IcarusVerilog. GTKWave is recommended for waveforms in case of the latter.

Some scripts or programs are included to make my life easier.
